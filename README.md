# ucfSpots

ucfSpots is a web application that helps UCF students find available study spaces and classrooms across campus. The app shows live building availability on an interactive map and provides detailed room status information.

## Features

- Interactive map and list: Visualize building availability or browse a searchable list.
- Real-time and time travel: check now or any date/time.
- Coverage: Academic classrooms across major UCF buildings.
- Room details:
  - See current/next class or event, availability duration, and view the full daily schedule (classes + events) for the selected date.
- Search and filters: find buildings fast with search and time-based filters.
- Feedback system: leave feedback directly from the app.

## How It Works

- Combines official class schedules with daily university event data to determine whether a room is in use at a specific date/time.
- A room is unavailable if any class or daily event overlaps the selected time; otherwise it's available. Availability ends at the earliest of the next class/event or building close. Very short gaps (< ~30 minutes) are not surfaced as "available" to avoid unusable slivers.
- Time travel: daily events are included for past dates and for future dates up to 14 days ahead; for dates further in the future, only class schedules and building hours are used.
- Timezone: all times are evaluated in campus local time (America/New_York), handling EST.

## Accuracy & Reliability

- Sources: class data from UCF Class Search system and daily events from events.ucf.edu.
- Freshness: daily events are scraped and updated regularly via a cron job; class/building data is refreshed via the data pipeline.
- Deterministic rules: availability for academic rooms is computed in SQL ([`database/functions/get_spots.sql`](database/functions/get_spots.sql)), using only official schedules + events and building hours.
- Known limitations:
  - Unofficial use (study groups, ad‑hoc meetings) and last‑minute changes may not be reflected.
  - Departmental access restrictions can make an "available" room unusable.
  - Special schedules (exams/holidays), maintenance closures, or data source outages can reduce accuracy.
  - Short "micro‑gaps" are intentionally filtered out (< ~30 minutes) to avoid noise.
  - Future dates exclude daily events; academic availability for future times uses class schedules + building hours only (events are only available per-day as they are published).

## Data Sources

- Course Catalog: [UCF Undergraduate Catalog](https://www.ucf.edu/catalog/undergraduate/#/courses).
- Class data: [UCF PeopleSoft Class Search](https://csprod-ss.net.ucf.edu/psc/CSPROD/EMPLOYEE/SA/c/COMMUNITY_ACCESS.CLASS_SEARCH.GBL). See the data flow in [`pipeline/README.md`](pipeline/README.md).
- Daily events: [events.ucf.edu](https://events.ucf.edu/).

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, Mapbox.
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Next.js API Routes, SQL functions (`database/functions`).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase project (PostgreSQL)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xxfmin/ucf-spots
cd ucf-spots/frontend
npm install
```

2. Supabase database

- Create a database (e.g., via Supabase).
- Apply schema: run [`database/schema/tables.sql`](database/schema/tables.sql) in the SQL editor.
- Add cache tables: run [`database/schema/cache_tables.sql`](database/schema/cache_tables.sql).
- Add functions: run [`database/functions/get_spots.sql`](database/functions/get_spots.sql) and [`database/functions/get_room_schedule.sql`](database/functions/get_room_schedule.sql).
- Add cached versions: run [`database/functions/get_cached_spots.sql`](database/functions/get_cached_spots.sql) and [`database/functions/get_room_schedule_cached.sql`](database/functions/get_room_schedule_cached.sql).
- Add cache refresh function: run [`database/functions/refresh_room_availability_cache.sql`](database/functions/refresh_room_availability_cache.sql).

3. Environment

Create `.env.local` in the `frontend/` directory with:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
```

4. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.
